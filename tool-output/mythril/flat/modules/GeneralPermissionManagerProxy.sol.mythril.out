==== Exception State ====
SWC ID: 110
Severity: Low
Contract: GeneralPermissionManagerStorage
Function name: [allDelegates(uint256), allDelegates(uint256)] (ambiguous)
PC address: 474
Estimated Gas Usage: 645 - 740
A reachable exception has been detected.
It is possible to trigger an exception (opcode 0xfe). Exceptions can be caused by type errors, division by zero, out-of-bounds array access, or assert violations. Note that explicit `assert()` should only be used to check invariants. Use `require()` for regular input checking.

==== Delegatecall Proxy ====
SWC ID: 112

Contract: OwnedUpgradeabilityProxy
Function name: fallback
PC address: 2172
Estimated Gas Usage: 714 - 3443
The contract implements a delegatecall proxy.
The smart contract forwards the received calldata via delegatecall. Note that callers can execute arbitrary functions in the callee contract and that the callee contract can access the storage of the calling contract. Make sure that the callee contract is audited properly.DELEGATECALL target: 0x0
